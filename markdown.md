Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. A markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text, meaning when the document is processed for display, the markup language is not shown, and is only used to format the text.
Markdown syntax is designed to be readable and unobtrusive, so the text in Markdown files can be read even if it isnâ€™t rendered.

The text is stored in a file that has an .md or .markdown extension. 

Markdown applications use a Markdown processor to take the formatted text and output it to HTML format, it can be viewed directly in a web browser or combined with a style sheet.
